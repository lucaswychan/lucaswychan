## About Me

I'm Lucas Chan, an MPhil candidate at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk) supervised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). My research spans embedding model and LLM reasoning. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Electronic Engineering (First Class Honours) from HKUST.

## Projects

- **[Neural Network Framework](https://github.com/lucaswychan/neuralnet-cpp/) (C++)**: A [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)-like framework built from scratch in C++ (STL only), where modules can be dynamically stacked without considering the implementation of forward and backward propagation. Currently support MLP and CNN.
- **[Neural Stock Prophet](https://github.com/lucaswychan/neural-stock-prophet/)**: A [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/neuralstockprophet/) for stock forecasting using LSTM, Attention, and ARIMA.
- **[Federated Edge AI for 6G](https://github.com/lucaswychan/Federated-Edge-AI-For-6G)**: Addressed computation and communication heterogeneity in federated learning using FedDyn and RIS-FL.

## Current Interests
