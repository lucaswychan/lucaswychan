## Hello

I’m Lucas Chan, an MPhil student at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk), working under the guidance of Professor [Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). My research spans embedding models and LLM reasoning. I hold a Bachelor’s degree with a double major in [Computer Science](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk) & [Electronic Engineering](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk) (First Class Honours) from HKUST.

I have been working as an AI Research Intern at [Amber Group](https://ambergroup.io), where my work focuses on LLM training and AI Agent applications. In my spare time, I also build some interesting projects. View my [GitHub](https://github.com/lucaswychan) to explore those gripping projects.                                                               
                                                                                                                            
## Research Interests                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                            
- **Representation Learning** - Latent Space, Representation Similarity, and Manifold
- **Large Language Models** — Reasoning, training, alignment, and safety
- **AI Agents** — Autonomous systems, tool use, and multi-agent cooperation
