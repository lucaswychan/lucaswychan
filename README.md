## Greeting !

I am Lucas Chan, and I am currently pursuing an MPhil degree at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk), where my research focuses on [multimodal learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_learning), [knowledge graphs](https://neo4j.com/blog/what-is-knowledge-graph/), and [large vision language models (LVLMs)](https://huggingface.co/blog/vlms). Under the supervision of [Professor Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/), I am exploring the intersections of these cutting-edge fields in artificial intelligence. Prior to my MPhil study, I obtained my Bachelor's degree with a double major in [Computer Science](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk) and [Electronic Engineering](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk) at HKUST, and graduated with First Class Honours.

Currently, I am expanding my research into multimodal learning, with a particular focus on developing high-quality question generation systems using [Multimodal LVLMs agents](https://www.superannotate.com/blog/llm-agents). This emerging area of study represents an exciting frontier in AI research, and I welcome collaborative opportunities and intellectual discourse on this topic.

My academic work spans several areas of machine learning and its applications. Currently I am developing a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)-like neural network framework in pure C++ from scratch, using only C++ STL. It simulates the flexibility and extensibility of PyTorch, and I am planning to add more modules such as CNN and Transformer in the future. For more details you can refer to [here](https://github.com/lucaswychan/neuralnet-cpp/).

My portfolio also includes significant contributions to other machine learning domains. Notable among these are:

- [Neural Stock Prophet](https://github.com/lucaswychan/neural-stock-prophet/): A [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/neuralstockprophet/) that integrates advanced algorithms such as [LSTM neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) with [attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)) and [Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) models for sophisticated stock forecasting.
- [Car License Recognition](https://github.com/lucaswychan/car-plate-recognition): An optical character recognition (OCR) system employing [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) techniques for accurate vehicle license plate identification.
- [Federated Edge AI for 6G](https://github.com/lucaswychan/Federated-Edge-AI-For-6G): A novel approach combining [Federated Dynamic Regularization (FedDyn)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04263) and [Reconfigurable Intelligence Surface assisted Federated Learning (RIS-FL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10282) to address computation and communication heterogeneity in [federated learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning) environments.
